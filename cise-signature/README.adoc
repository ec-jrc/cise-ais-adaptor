== CISE Signature

The CISE Signature is a library that allow to sign and verify CISE Messages
exchanged by the node and the adaptor of the CISE environment.
It may be used by both adaptor and nod implementer and uses


[[usage]]
=== Quick Start

The sign and verify a cise message its necessary to instantiate a
``SignatureService`` object and use the two method ``sign`` and
``verify``.

==== SignatureService instantiation
To use the signature service it’s sufficient to use the builder
``SignatureServiceBuilder`` through the static method ``newSignatureService()``


[source,java]
----
    SignatureService signature = newSignatureService(xmlMapper)
            .withKeyStoreName("adaptor.jks")
            .withKeyStorePassword("eucise")
            .withPrivateKeyAlias("sim1-node01.node01.eucise.fr")
            .withPrivateKeyPassword("eucise")
            .build();
----

The parameters to be passed to the builder are described in the following table.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| Parameter           | Description
|KeyStore Name
|is the filename of the keystore. The `String` parameter
may refer to a file in the classpath or to file in the
filesystem.

Examples: +
a file in the root of the classpath will referred like this:
``.withKeyStoreName("in-the-root.txt)`` +
while a file in the filesystem will be referred like this:
``.withKeyStoreName("/home/myuser/in-the-root.txt)``

|KeyStore Password
|is the password to access the keystore

|Private Key Alias
|is the alias that identify the _key pair_ in the keystore that will
be used to sign the CISE message.

Example: +
``sim1-node01.node01.eucise.fr`` may find the key pair existing in
the keystore associated to the sender id used to sign the cise message.

|Private Key Password
|is the password to access the key pair
|===

==== Signing a message

To sign a cise message is necessary to use a SignatureService object
and call the sign method as in the example:

[source,java]
----
    SignatureService signature = newSignatureService()...;

    Message message = newPush()...;

    Message signedMsg = signature.sign(message);
----

==== Verifying a message signature

To verify a cise message is necessary to use a SignatureService object
and call the sign method as in the example:

[source,java]
----
    SignatureService signature = newSignatureService()...;

    signature.verify(signedMsg);
----

----

When a message is issued by an adaptor or by a node it must be signed in
order to allow the receiver to check the validity and the provenience of
it.

Let’s imagine the following scenario: in an authority FOO the adaptor
ADAPTOR-1 needs to sign a message to be sent to the node NODE-1.

The adaptor must own the following keychain:

1.  *ROOT-CA.FOO.CERT*: a root (self signed) certificate to certify the
authority identity +
2.  *SIGNING-CA.FOO.CERT*: a signing certificate, signed by the
ROOT-CA.FOO.CERT that will be used to sign all the certificates issued
for the nodes and the adaptors.
3.  *ADAPTOR-1.FOO.KP*: the certificate and private key of the ADAPTOR-1
that will be used to perform the signature of the message;

The node must own the following keychain:

1.  *ROOT-CA.FOO.CERT*: a root (self signed) certificate to certify the
authority identity +
2.  *SIGNING-CA.FOO.CERT*: a signing certificate, signed by the
ROOT-CA.FOO.CERT that will be used to sign all the certificates issued
for the nodes and the adaptors.

[[signing-the-message]]
==== Signing the message
To sign a message, the adaptor needs to add into the message the
following information:

.  The signature of the whole message content (service and data model);
.  The adaptor certificate that is able to validate the signature.

Before signing the content the adaptor will:

.  Normalize the XML message structure using an XSLT template;
.  Sign the normalized message using the ADAPTOR-1 private key, thus
obtaining a binary hash;
.  Encode the hash in a ?base64? format and add it to an XMLSignature
element;
.  Add the ADAPTOR-1 certificate to the XMLSignature element;
.  Add the XMLSignature element to the original XML message.

[[verifying-the-message]]
==== Verifying the message
To verify the message it will be necessary to:

.  Extract the XMLSignature elements: signature and certificate;
.  Verify the signature with the certificate;
.  Verify the certificate keychain (in this case only with the
signing-ca).

[[java-keystores]]
==== Java KeyStores
The java keystore needed by the adaptor contains the following elements:

CER(root-ca.eucise.fr) <- certificate of the root CA
CER(signing-ca.eucise.fr) <- certificate of signing CA
CER(apache.node01.eucise.fr) <- certificate of the NODE/Gateway
KEY-PAIR(sim1-node01.node01.eucise.fr) <- adaptor public and private keys

[[todo]]
=== TODO
Check that the certificate is valid within the current date
Check that the sender id and the certificate issuer are the same when receiving a message from
an adaptor
