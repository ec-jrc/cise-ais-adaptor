== Configuring the AIS Adaptor
A very important part should be the configuration of the adaptor done through the file `ais-adaptor.properties`.

Please open it an put the relevant value to connect to the gateway, to declare your service id and operation and the service profile of the services your AIS tracks should be sent to.



.General configurations
|===
|Property Name |Description
|gateway.address | is the url where to contact the node/gateway
|ais-source.file.name | the default implementation of this adaptor is using a file to load the ais tracks. This properties specifies the absolute file path where to find it.
|demo-environment| this property must be disregarded and must be set to false
|override-timestamps| settint this property to true will overwrite the timestamp arrived from the AIS transponder with the current instant in which the message is processed in the adaptor.
|processing.idle.time| is the time that will be waited between the processing of two messages. Has been introduced to avoid to stress the server running the adaptor with a to tight reading loop.
|processing.sending.timeout|If the processing.entities-per-message is > 1 it means that messages will be sent only when the number of entities will reach that number. The timeout property is needed to avoid that a message stays in a buffer  without being sent because is waiting to reach the number of entities to complete the buffer. The unit of measure is specified with the following convention in time units:

  ns, nano, nanos, nanosecond, nanoseconds
  us, Âµs, micro, micros, microsecond, microseconds
  ms, milli, millis, millisecond, milliseconds
  s, second, seconds
  m, minute, minutes
  h, hour, hours
  d, day, days
 Example of valid expressions:
  100ns
  3 m
  1 hour
  20s
|processing.entities-per-message|A CISE Message can contain a list of entities (Vessel in this case). This property wait to have at least the specified number of entities before composing and sending the message

.Sender configuration
|===
|Property Name |Description
|sender.service.id |
|sender.service.data-freshness-type |
|sender.service.sea-basin-type|
|sender.service.participant.url|
|sender.service.operation|

.Message configuration

=== Push or Subscribe messages
The adaptor can send two different kind of messages:

- Push Unknown
- Publish (Push Subscribe)

==== Push Unknown
TBD
