# Releases

## 2019-01-10
- added the support to messages of type 'Push' and ServiceOperation 'Subscribe'. This features allows to interact directly with the light client.

## 2018-10-17
- added the ServiceType field in the xml that is a mandatory field requested by the Simulator.
- added a timeout in the message sending. The application will collect a ``processing.entities-per-message`` number of entities (vessels) before packing a cise message and send it. In the unfortunate case that collecting the entities stops for a while before reaching the number of vessel triggering the sending, the vessels would stay unsent in a buffer. A timeout has been added to trigger the send of the cise message in this case.
- added the support for multiple service profile to be added to the message.
