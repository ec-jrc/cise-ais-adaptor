# Releases

## 2019-01-11 v1.1
- added the Publish/Subscribe communication pattern.
- added the missing attribute locationRole to the translation of message type 5.
- computed the ETA for AIS message of type 5 in a more precise way. It is now setting
  an ETA trying to guess the closest date to today. Note: the ais message don't
  include the year of the ETA and that might create some ambiguities.
- added the support to messages of type 'Push' and ServiceOperation 'Subscribe'. This features allows to interact directly with the light client.
- The AisStreamGenerator to be used to read the ais tracks can now be loaded at runtime using a specific configuration property.
- Fixed an error on the datetime passed to the translation of the eta ais field.
- Added the capability to use a delimiter different from \n specified in the property file.
- The printing of the configuration at boot time will shade the properties named `password`.
- Updated and improved documentation.

## 2018-10-17 v1.0
- added the ServiceType field in the xml that is a mandatory field requested by the Simulator.
- added a timeout in the message sending. The application will collect a ``processing.entities-per-message`` number of entities (vessels) before packing a cise message and send it. In the unfortunate case that collecting the entities stops for a while before reaching the number of vessel triggering the sending, the vessels would stay unsent in a buffer. A timeout has been added to trigger the send of the cise message in this case.
- added the support for multiple service profile to be added to the message.

## 2018-07-04 Beta release
- First publicly available release
